IQ Test Rules:
     Beer sold at $2 each.
     4 empty bottle caps can be exchanged for a new Beer
     2 empty bottles can be exchanged for a new Beer
The Question is:
     How many beers can I drink with $10 ?
     
So we try to solve this problem, by writing a computer program in a programming language called "Go". 
Google search for "Golang"
